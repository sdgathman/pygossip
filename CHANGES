0.1	Initial alpha release
	The library works in a production milter
	The server works in testing
	Used GPL license because I started with C implementation
	which is GPL.  There isn't much left of the original C code
	except comments, but GPL is a safe starting license.  I
	can provide a PSF license later if needed.
