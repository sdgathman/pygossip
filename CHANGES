0.4	Add locking to client to prevent mixing results.
	Add Reset command.
0.3	Fix loop in server
	Make client query result match server (remove extra ':')
	Optional datadir config
0.2	Beta release
	Persistent connections for server
	Lots of bug fixes for peer protocol.
	Aggregation math improved - confidence used for weighted average,
	rather than adjusting reputation toward 0.
0.1	Initial alpha release
	The library works in a production milter
	The server works in testing
	Used GPL license because I started with C implementation
	which is GPL.  There isn't much left of the original C code
	except comments, but GPL is a safe starting license.  I
	can provide a PSF license later if needed.
