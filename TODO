Log client host/ip.

Make GOSSiP protocol asynchronous.  Threads share the persistent
connection, and the server currently uses a single thread for each
connection, so it is sufficient to lock the client for each query.  But 
in the future, replies may come out of order and need to be dispatched by UMIS.

Peer reputation needs to be persistent.  When reset at restart, peers take 
too long to reach enough confidence to affect the result.

Allow multiple feedback - allowing users to correct content filter judgement.
Keep UMIS in queue until it falls off, instead of removing on first feedback.

Purge old records nightly.

DONE Sometimes pygossip server goes into a loop.  Seems to have started
  happening since clients started using persistent connections.
DONE Client Socket errors:
DONE Use persistent connections for client.py.
